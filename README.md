Yet another repository for learning C, RISC-V and operating systems in general.  
This repository will serve as my learning progress.


## My plan for this repo and my learning journey

main:       -> the always-working, always-bootable kernel
by-the-book -> the one from os 1000
libc-impl:  -> hand-rolled C library functions + tests (string, memory, etc.)
kernel:     -> touches core kernel code (scheduler, traps, vm) ~ coming soon
testing:    -> temporary experiments, proof-of-concepts ~ coming soon
fs:         -> file system ~ coming soon
drivers:    -> drivers ~ coming soon

### Branches available currently:
- main
- libc-impl


## Why am I doing this?

I want to properly organize my learning journey as how a real low-level developer would do.


## Learned things so far...

- I have managed to understand how does a strcpy works and re-implement it based on C Standard Library.
